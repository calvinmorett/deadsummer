    <title>Dead Summer | Devin B + Oz Alone</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="Dead Summer. Collaborations often hold an essential presence creatively and in the instance of upstate emcees Devin B and Oz Alone, this pairing came at the proper time and place. Both vocalists found each other through their alternative, off-the-beaten-path approaches stylistically and their eccentricities as individuals and musicians made for a naturally favorable partnership.
While the music of Devin B and Oz Alone falls under the hip hop umbrella, their obscurities within the genre are accessible to listeners and the result is reflective of the musicians themselves - hearty, rugged and original. The authenticity behind these emcees is exuberant and the music finds its strengths in the artists themselves knowing their own genuine voices, talents and perspectives and knowing how to build off of one another productively. While many risks are taken in the duo’s debut album lyrically and in the production and delivery itself, it is not just for the sake of taking a risk but more so for the element of storytelling and honest self-expression. There is no need to push further than necessary; Dead Summer takes on its own form through its own acknowledged strangeness.
Dead Summer marks both the beginning and celebration of this new group and project. With production by Adrian (last name? moniker?), the two vocalists interweave and coexist flawlessly in their debut project, making it clear this collaboration is as smooth and bona fide as they come. Both are going down the road less traveled and celebrating whoever wants to walk in their direction. Devin B and Oz Alone are on the same page in their individual journeys to work towards the next thing, and simply put, Dead Summer is the next thing. 

Oz Alone 
Coming from a background in the written word and a self-described inability to sing in his earlier years, Oz Alone has learned how to apply his poetry to fit into the world of hip hop. After growing out of being hesitant to share his talents, words and rhymes with others, Oz now can’t picture his artistry being expressed differently.
Based out of Saratoga Springs, Oz Alone has collaborated with a handful of artists, most notably fellow upstate New York-based rapper Dev B, working together as the group moniker, Dead Summer. An enthusiast of good friends, good music and good conversation, Oz’s music travels into darker, deeper depths, balancing the complexities of life with the simplicities. 
Creating under the name Oz Alone, based off of a family name Osmel and the word “alone”, Oz feels as though being alone is the most primal of all fears, only rivaled by death, and his lyrics relate to exploring such topics. In the game for a decade but getting serious for the craft in 2010, Oz has noted David Bowie and El-P as a couple of his many influences. As a rapper, writer and performer, Oz’s poetic influence is clear and his approach to music is his own - distinctive, conscious and inquisitive.

Dev B
Devin B came into the recording booth in 2008 with the strength of a writer, a love for hip hop and an important hunger to contribute positively. Being introduced as a teenager to the possibilities that surround the genre helped Devin to see there was a place for him within it - one that is intellectual, comedic and creative.
Balancing being a wandering cynic and a subtle optimist plays to his strengths as an artist, with his music acting as a self-described basket he carries his demons in. Lyrically, Devin B plays with comedy, realism, doubt and hope all at once. Releasing his first full-length album The Jump in 2013 on Sub-Bombin Records, Devin B has worked with various members of the independent label, such as Midas, Rawhead, Sime Gezus, Mitochi and Odisbey, the latter two who produced his debut album. Most recently, Dev released what he considers a personal foreshadowing of his latest duo project Dead Summer, titled The Awakening. Produced by Ryan Barber of Evermore Alliance, The Awakening is another addition to Devin’s discography; one that plays with identity, rebirth, lost love, revitalization and transitioning.
As an artist, and human being in general, Devin’s MO is avoiding repetition and stagnancy, with his music acting as a documentation of his personal growth and continual search for inner peace. Enjoying creating under his own birth name, feeling that no name can better define him than his own, Devin B finds pleasure in the spontaneous, taking his mind off of daily neuroses and the vital power that humor holds, all while searching for something both bigger and relatable.
